# Naive_Bayes_experiments
Using the Naive Bayes algorithm and model to make predictions

In this project, I will experiment with Naive Bayes algorithm to do 2 following jobs:
- **Decision Making**: Decide wether I am going for a hike or not this weekend given the weather conditions over the last 2 months.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Make predictions on restaurant reviews to see if people liked or disliked a restaurant.
